# Car-Park
The primary objective of the project is to automatically identify vacant parking spots in real-time. This is achieved by employing OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library that provides various functions for image processing and analysis. OpenCV enables the system to capture live video feed from cameras placed in the car park and perform image analysis to detect the presence of vehicles in each parking space.

Additionally, the project utilizes Pickle, a Python module for object serialization. Pickle is used to store and retrieve data related to the status of parking spaces. By serializing the information about each parking spot's occupancy status, the system can maintain a record of available and occupied spaces, enabling efficient tracking and detection of empty spots.

In summary, the "Car Park" project combines the capabilities of OpenCV and Pickle to develop a smart parking system that can identify vacant parking spaces in real-time, allowing drivers to quickly locate available spots within a car park.
